 you can also perform arithmetics by saying 'calculation'
 for opening a website just "open and name of the page(for websites with .com domain otherwise say open url, url should be like- www.something.in)"
 for performing a google search just say "search item"
 IN all other cases the current version will just perform a google search and will lead you to the output
 For using the bot again and again in a single go you need to press the speak button every time you wish to look for something
